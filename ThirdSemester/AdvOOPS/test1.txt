In this article, I have discussed how to connect to mysql
 database remotely using python.
 For any application it is very important to store database on 
 a server for easy data access.
 It is quite complicated to connect to database remotely because every 
 service provider do not
 provide remote access to mysql database. 
Here I am using python MySQLdb module for connecting to our database
 which is at any server 
that provide remote access.
